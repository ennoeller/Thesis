In the few years previous to 2010, tablets started to circle the market and nobody saw exactly how it would affect the devices we own. In 2010 Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Incorporation, predicted that tablets would overtake PCs (personal computer). Slowly tablets have reduced the sales gap and in 2015 that prediction will probably come true. \cite{tabletsales}

Though PCs will not go anywhere in the near future, it still means that tablets and phones are becoming the main tools for people to access social media. That in mind, when we look at these devices, we can immediately notice the size and lack of peripherals compared to PCs, raising the concern of input difficulty. In particular, inputting complicated passwords, that require precision to the last letter. 

Those, with  more knowledge and use experience with Android devices will recall that Android devices usually keep applications logged in with no need to re-authenticate. Though that is mainly true, there are cases, where re-authentication is necessary. Android tends to log out the user, when the applicaton is updated. 

As mentioned previously, Android devices are becoming common for households and therefore these devices need to accompany not only one, but many users raising the second and more common case for re-authentication.

\section{Summary}
As Android devices are slowly taking over from PCs it needs to pick up some of PCs attributes. The following sections focus on a solution to make Android devices for multiple users. This solution is developed as a part of this thesis.
