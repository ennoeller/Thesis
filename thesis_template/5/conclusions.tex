\chapter{Conclusions and Future Directions} % top level followed by section, subsection
Mobile devices are becoming more common every day, but the authentication methods used are still those designed for PCs. The traditional username-password authentication method does not meet the characteristics of a smartphone and is therefore inconvenience to the user. It degrades the user experience, hence puts the mobile applications in a bad light.

To solve this problem, a library was developed to make the mobile authentication process more user-friendly. Instead of typing, a pattern-based authentication is used. It utilizes a small screen of a mobile device in better manner, giving the user more room for mistakes. This result in a better user experience. 

Although, the usability of the developed solution was validated, it needs more work until it can be used in a real application. The credentials stored in a database are simple text and need to be encrypted. The interface could be made more intuitive and attractive for the user. Also range of tests should be conducted for any security and stability issues. 

All in all, the feedback received from the survey group was strongly positive, implying there is room for improvements in the mobile authentication methods. It gives hope that, in the future the mobile device users could be introduced to new methods in authentication that appreciate the characteristics of a smartphone and are user friendly.
